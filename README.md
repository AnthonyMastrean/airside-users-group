# Airside Users' Group

It's damn near impossible to get into the city at 5p, why not meet near the airport instead?

## Getting Started

I'm going to try to bootstrap a users' group on github! I don't want to pay for meetup.com or get locked into any of the other tools, so let's make this up as we go along.

## Roadmap

 * use issues, labels, and milestones well
 * make an organization, email, & twitter account for these repos
 * make a github-pages driven website (using Octopress?) to publish info, events (ical links?), and other updates
